                <p>This helps you not to lose your mind while trying to remember everything. Plus, it makes communication easier. Mom is often the one person that gets asked where everything is or which event takes place when. So having everything written out, and put in a central place- whether itâ€™s an online spreadsheet or family message bord, can be really helpful!!!!!!!</p>
